How it works:
1. This will upadte every minute to get 10 most recent tweets from salesforce by default. 
2. Support multiple keywords search functionality. Keywords are separated by space.
3. When user delete all the keywords the app will start updating again.

2 Install php and spent some time to learn how to write php basic code.
3 Download a script wrapper to load data from Twitter API and learn how to use it.
4 Download curl and certificates for php.
5 create an App on twitter and get tokens.
6 Send get request to Twitter API and get json response.
